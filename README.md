Step 1: extract "makerBETA.7z.001", then run "makerBETA" and enter a name for your virus
Step 2: pick which type of virus you would like for your victim (trojan, malware, adware, etc.)
Step 3: wait for download proccess to finish, close the program, and your virus will be in the folder 

Congrats! You made your first virus, have fun with this.
