Virus Maker | by: Reseno | *THIS IS ONLY FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES*

if you need the script and all repositories, it'll be in my github (Reseno9)

*note*: this isn't the finished version, there may be bugs, let me know in my github

Step 1: extract "file.7z.001", then place the file in the "VirusTool-main" folder, then run "makerBETA.bat" and enter a name for your virus
Step 2: pick which type of virus you would like for your victim (trojan, malware, adware, etc.)
Step 3: wait for download proccess to finish, close the program, and your virus will be in the folder 

Congrats! You made your first virus, have fun with this.

ps: if you ran the example virus and want it to stop, just turn off your pc and turn it back on.
